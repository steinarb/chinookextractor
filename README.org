* Transform Chinook data to JSON

This repository contains a Java utility that extracts data from a
[[http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/][Chinook sample database]] and transform the results to JSON.

The Chinook sample database is an Open Source replacement for the
"Northwind" database owned by Microsoft.  The Chinook database lists
music customers and their purchases.

This utility is packaged as a maven project, created with m2e in
eclipse.
