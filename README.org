* Transform Chinook data to JSON

This repository contains a Java utility that extracts data from a
[[https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database][Chinook sample database]] and transform the results to JSON.

The resulting JSON was used to populate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch][elasticsearch]] when trying out elasticsearch in 2013/2014.

The Chinook sample database is an Open Source replacement for the
"Northwind" database owned by Microsoft.  The Chinook database lists
music customers and their purchases.

This utility is packaged as a maven project, created with m2e in
eclipse.
